- Go through the example presented, so as to understand the operation being done in the experiment to optimize the weighted matching problem.
- Select the type of relaxation.
- Select a graph type with given number of nodes along with the location of the nodes in a 2-D plane.
- Click on 'Init' to initialize the graph.
- After observing the set of points generated and the equations used to optimize the weighted graph, click on 'Anneal' to start annealing the network.
- Go through the output of the problem and the output states of nodes after each update.
