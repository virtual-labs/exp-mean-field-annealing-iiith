- Deterministic relaxation can get stuck in local minima depending on the starting point.
- Stochastic relaxation uses simulated annealing at different temperatures with probablistic update, which can help the network get out of the local minima, to settle for a deeper minima.
- Stochastic relaxation can take time to reach equilibrium.
- Mean-field annealing is used to speed up the process.
